# Introduction

Gentle reader,&#x20;

Welcome to this Plutus course. The aim of the course is to teach you the basics of Plutus for Cardano smart contract development. This course will use PlutusV2. To get the most out of the course, it is recommended to have an understanding of the fundamentals of Haskell and the basic usage of `cardano-cli`.

Before starting any practical work with the so-called smart contracts, it is extremely important to have a good understanding of the underlying accounting model used on Cardano - EUTxO.
